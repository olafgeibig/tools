# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# Ignore Patterns
attic/
docs/

# Coding
- Use Python 3.12 features and syntax
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use type hints everywhere possible
- Use list, dict, and set comprehensions when appropriate for concise and readable code.
- Prefer pathlib over os.path for file system operation
- Use explicit exception handling. Catch specific exceptions rather than using bare except clauses
- Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single task
- Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods
- Use dataclasses for data containers when appropriate
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible
- Use logging for debugging and monitoring
- Use meaningful variable and method names

# Development
- Use pytest for unit testing
- Do not create tests unless requested by the user
- Use uv for dependency management

## Using uv 
- use 'uv add <dependency name>' to add dependencies
- use 'uv remove <dependency name>' to remove dependencies
- Create uv scripts for running scripts in pyproject.toml [project.scripts]
- Use hatchling as the build-system

## Running
- Ensure activate the venv before spawning a new console session: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Use uv scripts to run something

# Using Tools (MCP)
- Use the deepwiki tool to ask questions about a library
- Use the context7 tool to look up the documentation of a library.
- Use the tavily tool to search for information on the web and extract content form websites.
